                    That’s the question that guided our team as we took on the challenge of redesigning Bramble’s desktop website. 
                    As a new real estate brokerage with bold claims and cutting-edge technology, Bramble needs an interface that 
                    not only reflects its innovation but also instills confidence in buyers and sellers navigating one of the most 
                    important decisions of their lives.

                            The original interface lacked clear communication of Bramble’s unique AI features and core benefits, like the flat-fee rebate.
                            Users were unfamiliar with Bramble’s nontraditional model.

                    We sought to understand user perceptions of trust and innovation in real estate tech. Interviews and interface audits revealed that users struggled to grasp Bramble’s differentiators.
                    Many associated advanced features with complexity, which reinforced the need for simplified, intuitive explanations of Bramble’s AI workflows and pricing model.

                <p>
                    To solve these problems, we each created <strong>independent interface sketches</strong> and then <strong>collaboratively critiqued</strong> our sketches to <strong>identify essential features</strong>.
                </p>

                <h3>Independent Sketches</h3>
                <p>To begin our design process, each member of our team brainstormed a distinct design for Bramble’s desktop interface. Each set of sketches focused on exploring different layouts, visual hierarchies, and flows for the core user actions we established in the form of a home page, explore page, and FAQ page! (Note: 1-Rahel, 2-Jowet, 3-Annie, 4-Selena)

                    <h3>Scrollable Homepage</h3>
                    <p>Feedback led to a redesign of the homepage to be scrollable, with distinct sections for brand messaging, the search bar, and key differentiators.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The CEO <b>suggested using a different secondary color</b>, as Bramble berry doesn’t work well for backgrounds and should be used sparingly. We felt like the colors went well together but have liked to <b>experiment with different color schema</b> if we had more time. 
                    </li>
                    <li>He recommended <b>clarifying the search bar functionality</b> to better guide users on how to use it and highlight the three search queries offered by Bramble: by address, by link and by natural language search.
                    </li>
                    <li>He noted that some parts of the UI, like filters and the expanded home view, could be <b>simplified or made more visual to improve clarity and usability</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Additionally, he appreciated the emphasis on visuals, especially the property display screen, and encouraged exploring video integration.

                    <li>Building out sellers page to evaluate seller experiences. The CEO did not provide in-depth feedback when we asked about how seller's operate on the platform, so we focused on the user experiences of home-buyers on the platform.
                    </li>
                    <li>Adding additional listings to motivate use of AI features</li>
                    <li>We implemented the functionality of allowing a user to meet the main business goal of being able to see a listing. Going forward we would like to <b>enhance user experience by making the search and filter functional</b>.</li>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Throughout our iterative design process, our team learned the <b>importance of balancing user needs with business goals</b> and <b>continuously improving based on feedback</b>. Let quickly highlight a few key parts of this process:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>We started with a bunch of different sketches, then combined the strongest ideas into a wireframe</b> that aligned with Bramble’s business goals.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>After presenting to our TA, we made improvements</b> like turning our home screen into a scrollable page, adding clearer visual structure, and making elements like listing cards more obviously clickable.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>We recognized a recurring challenge as users struggled to understand how AI was integrated</b> into the company. So we reached out to the CEO and learned more about the AI features. Now that we were better informed<b> we decided to include a section explaining Bramble’s AI workflows</b> on the landing page.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>User testing ensured the functionality of our hifi prototype </b>and allowed us to see the interactions of those not familiar with the class or project!
                        </li>
                        <li><b>We then reached out to the CEO again to share our final prototype and get his feedback.</b> Although we did not have the time to implement the changes he suggested we were satisfied with the positive comments he made and that he felt like we accurately conveyed his mission and business goals. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Overall, we learned to appreciate the collaboration and back and forth nature of designing a functional application. If we had more time, we would focus on making the product more interactive. <b>This project taught us a lot about designing with users in mind and being open to change along the way to increase the memorability, learnability and efficiency of an application. </b></p>
                 </p>
